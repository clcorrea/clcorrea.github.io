						Here, North is more than just a sense of place or where we are.
						It's a sense of purpose. It's who we are. North sees straight to 
						the problem and gets straight to fixing it. North elevates thinking 
						and gives rise to new theories and ideas. North changes perspectives 
						and brings people together. North answers the call to action and keeps 
						lifting our communities. North takes what it's given and makes something 
						more. North never stops asking: "What's next?"
