					At NVU-Johnson, you'll receive a high-quality public liberal 
					arts education in a student-centered environment. You'll 
					graduate empowered and prepared to deal with complexity, 
					diversity and change through innovation â€” a critical career 
					advantage in a globalized economy. Today's employers want 
					their workforce to think creatively, communicate clearly 
					and solve complex problems. The balance of broad knowledge 
					and specific skills you'll receive from Vermont's premier 
					public liberal arts institution will arm you with the kind 
					of college education employers are looking for.
